          <h3>Winrate is King</h3>
          <p>In Hearthstone, winrate is king. Deck guides advertise it, tier lists are decided by it, even going infinite in Arena is tied to achieving a certain winrate.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Winrates can seem like promises: if you learn this deck and play enough games, you too can win 60% of the time and earn that sweet legend card back. It sounds naive, but this is essentially what drives netdecking: belief that we can replicate the success advertised. Unfortunately, things are not that simple. Let’s start with The Coin.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>The Coin</h3>
          <p>Turn 2 Scimitar, Elysiana + Baleful Banker –– no matter what deck you run, its gameplan changes (sometimes drastically) based on whether you go first or have the Coin. Certain decks, such as Aggro Rogue or the Exodia Mage ft. Open the Waygate, fare significantly better with the 0 mana spell than without it. Deck guides therefore should be supported by a sample of games that is split evenly between coin and no coin. Let’s say that the percentage of games on the Coin (the “Coin Rate”) should be between 45% - 55%.</p>
          <div class="img-container rounded">
              <img class="rounded centered" src="/articles/assets/coincurve.png" alt="Visualization of Coin Curve" />
              <p>"Coin Rate" vs Game Count</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <ul><li>if OP played 200 games, we can be ~86% sure of this — not bad
          </li><li>for a sample of 100 games (the VS minimum), there’s roughly 1 in 4 odds that the “Coin Rate” is outside 45% - 55%
          </li><li>at 50 games (/r/CompHS minimum), those odds rise to ~40%. There’s also a ~10% chance the Coin Rate is outside 40% - 60%. These kind of numbers would qualify an election as a landslide.
          </li></ul>
          <br>
          <p>Of course, your Coin Rate will converge to 50% given enough games. But in the short run, there is a decent chance it will fall (totally by chance) quite far from 50:50. When it does — and with the number of deck guides out there, it occasionally will — you should rebalance your sample.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Say I play 100 games with my homebrew reno shaman. I went first in 60 of those games, and second in the other 40. To rebalance, I calculate my winrate while going first and while going second separately, then average the 2 together, eliminating the overweighting of games where I went first. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Remember that this variance affects both the reader and the author. Though it is somewhat irresponsible for authors not to check their game samples for biases, it is equally foolish to write off a deck because I missed The Coin in 7 out of 10 games.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Ideal Winrate</h3>
          <p>Winrate represents the proportion of games that a deck <i>should</i> win over the long run, assuming a constant meta and a consistent pilot. Of course, those 2 assumptions never hold true, and the likelihood of winning a game is futher affected by other factors, such as:</p>
          <br>
          <ul><li>The Player. Are you…
          <ul><li>	experienced with the deck?
          </li><li>	familiar with meta? Do you know how to mulligan against each class?
          </li><li>	drunk? on tilt? tired?
          </li></ul></li><li>The Opponent. Is your opponent…
          <ul><li>	inexperienced or misplaying? competent at piloting their deck? on average, high legend players play better rank 5 players
          </li><li>	playing a “normal” list? running tech cards? playing wacky homebrew?
          </li></ul></li><li>RNG (unrelated to deck or player)
          <ul><li>	what cards are drawn? what discover options are offered?
          </li><li>	how does knife juggler throw? Did Yogg accept your prayers?
          </li></ul>
          </li></ul>
          <br>
          <p>Each factor feeds into the complex system that is a 100 game sample. Out of that system emerges a Winrate. You control the first major factor: deck and skill. Randomness decides the other two: your opponents and Hearthstone’s RNG.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As a result, winrates drawn from small samples can be unreliable, i.e. in the long run, they will not be replicated. In the short run, you are unlikely to reproduce the posted winrate, especially if you are new to piloting a deck in an unfamiliar meta (i.e. the “Player” factor is changed for the worse).</p>
          <br>
          <h3>What does Winrate mean for You?</h3>
          <p>For authors, this means being upfront about the anomalies you encounter while testing. Maybe you ran into unusually good matchups, or played the same guy 5 times in a row, or got the coin 60% of the time. When this does happen, consider rebalancing your sample. HSReplay and VS Meta Report provide live meta stats, so you can check if the “metagame” captured in your sample deviates significantly from what everyone else is seeing. If yes, that should be clear in the deck guide.</p>
          <br>
          <p>For those following deck guides, this means acknowledging that it may be a while before you replicate a deck’s success (if ever). Notice your bad luck, but don’t be tilted by it. When you draw poorly, or your opponent pulls the nuts, don’t reach for the tech cards, instead take that knowledge and file it away (in writing, preferably).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Lastly, understand that the meta is shifting underneath you: the meta where some deck reached legend last week may be very different from the one you face today.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>† Footnote of Caution: Rebalancing</h3>
          <p>Personally, I would love for deck guide writers to rebalance their samples, not only by Coin Rate, but also by metagame (i.e. rebalancing according to what decks you expect to run into).</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, this can lead to problems. Say Control Warrior is 30% of the meta, but you only played 5 out of 200 games against CW, and won 4 of those 5 with a clutch topdeck. Your experience against CW may be very unusual, and by rebalancing those 5 games to 30% of your winrate, you’d be badly misconstruing how effective the deck is against CW.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This kind of error due to overweighting affects  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html">political polls</a> . It could affect winrates too.</p>
