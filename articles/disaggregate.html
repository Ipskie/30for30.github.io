          <h3>Why You Should Disaggregate Your HS Data</h1>
            <p>A silly example: say you play 20 games of ZooLock a day, and have a decent sample size. You divide your
              games by the weekday they were plated (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)</p>
            <br>
            <p>You notice that Saturday’s winrate is noticeably lower, which doesn’t really make sense, until you
              consider that Friday is bar night. If you’re gunning for legend, that’s valuable information: either cut
              back the drinks or avoid playing with a hangover. (I warned you it was silly)</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is a (fictional) example of gaining insight though disaggregation. And though it sounds stupid, it’s
              pretty close to the advice Eloise gave <a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/3yymih/eloise_otk_warlock_top_10_legend_cn_server_xpost/">on
                /r/CompetitiveHS</a>.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>I strongly suggest you play at mid night. because when people get tired they don’t want to play around
                arcane combo. I get very insane winrate at mid night.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <h3>What is Disaggregation?</h3>
            <p>Disaggregation means splitting your data into categories, usually after collecting and lumping it all
              together (hence dis-aggregating). </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>The easiest example is Deck Matchups, e.g. What’s the winrate of Control Warrior against Zoolock? If
                you’re heading into a tournament, that informs your deck picks. If you’re on ladder, pick a deck that
                with a good winrate against today’s meta, not last week’s.
              </li>
              <li>Disaggregation is also behind card-by-card analysis. <a
                  href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/cu3kqu/using_data_to_improve_your_game/">This
                  writeup</a> breaks down how <a
                  href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/coc07b/aggro_rogue_featuring_zephrys_the_lethal/">Zephrys
                  the Lethal</a> is actually one of the worst cards in Aggro Rogue, based on this disappointing drawn
                winrate. This is an example of disaggregating Winrate by whether a certain card was drawn.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Problems with Disaggregation</h3>
            <p>Breaking data into distinct pieces lets us see the differences between them, but it can also make the
              data less reliable, since each piece has a smaller sample size.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Take Control Warrior. At time of writing, HSReplay has ~300,000 games with one list. That’s a big sample!
              But how many were vs. the new Murloc Paladin? How many against one specific list of Mrrrgl Pally? Are
              those games enough to publish a reliable Winrate?</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is easy to <i>over</i>-categorize your data, breaking it into pieces that are too small to be useful.
              Hearthstone may be absurdly popular, but data about it is thin on the ground. Even Vicious Syndicate
              (whose work I respect) cannot always gather the 100 game minimum to fully populate their matchup chart.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What else?</h3>
            <p>One of the ways we can fight these problems is to be smarter about the way we slice and dice the data. A
              few methods:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Fuzzy decklist. There are many variants of Combo Priest, but most differ by a Holy Ripple here, a
                Topsy Turvy there. If there are too few games to publish a reliable matchup winrate, why not aggregate
                similar decklists to get a better idea? This goes double for Highlander decks, which naturally have a
                million variations.
              </li>
              <li>Divide matchups by archetype. Matchups could be analyzed by the style of the opponent’s deck. Token
                druid might ‘play’ closer to ZooLock than to Combo or Quest druid. Aggro warrior and Aggro rogue
                certainly share more with it each other than Control Warrior.
              </li>
              <li>Look at board state. There is a mountain of untapped data in the board state. A simple example would
                be determining the best time to Brawl / Mass Hysteria / Earthquake. Is this board too small to AoE, or
                should I have thrown the brawl down against 3 minions? Questions like these are still unanalyzed, and
                the answers are lost because we only have a simple drawn winrate for each card in the deck.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Disaggregation & Game Design</h3>
            <p>Lastly, disaggregation can affect Hearthstone itself.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Disguised Toast’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9dpCK96XTI">analysis</a> of Animal
                Companion showed that while each Companion has an area of strength, each is about equally good.
              </li>
              <li>Or take the <a href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tuskarr_Totemic">Tuskarr Totemic nerf</a>,
                which was driven by the gap in winrates between basic vs 3/4 totems.
              </li>
              <li>Finally, this kind of thinking informed the design of the Coin, ensuring near perfect balance between
                going first or second.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>In summary, creative categorization of a data set can lead to more insight on the game, without the need
              for more data.</p>
